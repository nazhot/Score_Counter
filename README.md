# Score Counter
A React Native app, aimed at enhancing currently available score counting apps by adding features many of them lack.

## 📖 Overview
A score counter that is very simple to use, while being extremely flexible and feature rich for people looking to customize. It has the ability to store different games and their settings, so that you can quickly switch between your favorites, and not have to worry about changing around settings every time you begin a different game than your previous. It offers an extensive log, keeping track of the different games you've played, as well as each round, and has the option to keep track of why each player got the points they did to really paint a picture of how each round/game went. 

Beyond features aimed at improving your experience round to round, game to game, it also offers features that help your version stand out from the rest. It offers multiple color themes, ensuring newly added players aesthetically fit the rest, and giving you control of how the various components throughout the app look. Name themes are a small touch, but let you change up the names being picked when adding new players.
